4. git fetch: git fetch will bring changes from remote github branch to intermediatory branch called "origin/branch_name".

              eg: github remote branch: main, develop
                  intermediatory branch: origin/main , origin/develop

command: local-main> git fetch origin main  // bring changes from remote "main" branch to intermediatory branch "origin/main"
         local-main> git merge origin/main  // merge to local main branch from "origin/main" branch
